## 1. Introduction & Scope

### 1.1. Purpose and Authority

The **Ibex Gaming League (IGL)** organises competitive esports tournaments and leagues across various gaming titles. These competitions are governed by these **Official Rules** ("**Rules**" or "**Rulebook**"), together with **game-specific rulebooks** and **competition-specific regulations**, where applicable.

These Rules serve to:

- Ensure fair, transparent, and consistent competition across all Ibex Gaming League events
- Establish a clear legal framework and procedures for all stakeholders
- Provide binding guidelines for competitors, teams, administrators, and other participants
- Protect the integrity and reputation of competitive esports

### 1.2. Skill-Based Competition Declaration

**IMPORTANT LEGAL DISCLAIMER:** IGL competitions are **skill-based competitive events** that reward gaming proficiency, strategic thinking, teamwork, and competitive performance. These competitions are **NOT games of chance** within the meaning of the Swiss Federal Act on Money Games (AMG). Success in IGL competitions depends entirely on participant skill, preparation, and performance, not random chance or luck. Prize awards are based solely on competitive achievement and ranking.

### 1.3. Legal Framework and Binding Nature

By participating in any IGL competition, all participants ("**Competitors**," "**Players**," "**Teams**") unconditionally accept and agree to be bound by:

1. These Official Rules
2. Applicable game-specific rulebooks
3. Competition-specific regulations
4. All decisions made by IGL administrators and officials

**Administrative decisions made by IGL officials regarding competition matters are final and binding, except where appeal rights are specifically provided in Section 8 (Appeals Process) or where prohibited by applicable Swiss law. This finality clause does not limit participants' statutory rights under Swiss consumer protection, data protection, or other mandatory legal provisions.**

### 1.4. Applicability and Territorial Scope

These Rules apply to **all games and competitions organised by the Ibex Gaming League**, regardless of where participants are located, provided the competition or its effects occur within Switzerland or involve Swiss residents.

Each game title shall have **its own specific rulebook**, and individual competitions may introduce **additional special regulations**. Such special rules shall be published on the respective competition pages at **[ibexgaming.org](https://ibexgaming.org)** no later than fourteen (14) days prior to the commencement of the relevant competition.

### 1.5. Rule Hierarchy
